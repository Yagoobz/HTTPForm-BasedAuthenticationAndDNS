<h3>Step 1: Initiate a Basic HTTP Authentication</h3>
To capture HTTP traffic, I'll set the capture filter to port 80, as HTTP typically operates on this port. Using a non-private web server accessible to the public, I'll navigate to an HTTP page where I'll input both the correct and incorrect passwords. Upon entering the correct password, "password," I anticipate receiving an authentication message.
